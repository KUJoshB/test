# Project Summary and Welcome

Hi! This is the Roadmap for a project tentatively titled the OER of Scholcomm, or open textbook of scholarly communication librarianship. The short version is that scholcomm librarianship (to include other titles and positions that incorporate scholcomm topics and responsibilities) is a growing area of academic librarianship which is not yet widely taught in LIS programs. Librarians are entering into a profession for which they are not prepared. Our goal is to create a central resource, a textbook, as well as a rich environment of supplementary resources that will lead to greater instruction in LIS programs to address this need/gap.

## How to get involved

We are still in planning phase, looking for contributors and collaborators, and gathering data and input from stakeholders. If you’re a practicing professional who works on scholcomm topics, reach out! If you’re an LIS instructor with experience teaching scholcomm topics or interested in doing so, reach out! If you’re an LIS student interested in learning more about scholcomm, or scholcomm as a potential career area, reach out!

### Immediate needs:

We are in the early stages of an Institute for Museum and Library Services grant [\(LG-72-17-0132-17\)](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/LG-72-17-0132-17) to gather data to support and inform the resource/s we propose to create. This consists of 3 facets:

A survey or surveys of key stakeholder groups: practitioners, instructors, students
Focus groups at ALISE (conference of record for LIS faculty and phd students)
An event/unconference of scholcomm practitioners to work together for 2 days on informing and creating resource/s
